Security researchers unite!

We're tired of spending sleepless nights finding bugs in protocols only to have a payout of $500 when the economic damage totals in the millions.

I created this leaderboard to help inform the security community as to the projects that don't take security seriously so we can avoid them and spend time on the projects that do.
